## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid \`any\` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Components
```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary'
  onClick?: () => void
}

export function Button({ children, variant = 'primary', onClick }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      className={\`btn btn-\${variant}\`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}

// ❌ Avoid
export function Button(props: any) {
  return <button {...props} />
}
```

### CSS/Tailwind
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic class names for custom CSS
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography

```tsx
// ✅ Good
<div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8 md:px-6 lg:px-8">
  <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white md:text-3xl">
    Title
  </h1>
</div>

// ❌ Avoid
<div style={{ padding: '20px', margin: '10px' }}>
  <h1 style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    Title
  </h1>
</div>
```

### File Organization
- Use kebab-case for file names: \`user-profile.tsx\`
- Group related components in folders
- Keep components small and focused
- Use index files for clean imports

```
components/
├── ui/
│   ├── button.tsx
│   ├── card.tsx
│   └── index.ts
├── forms/
│   ├── join-form.tsx
│   └── contact-form.tsx
└── layout/
    ├── navbar.tsx
    └── footer.tsx
```
